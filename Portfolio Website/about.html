<h1>About me</h1>

<br>

<div class="aboutme">
    <p>I am currently in my second year at the University of Huddersfield studying Information Technology. I am originally from Nottinghamshire but currently living in Huddersfield for university. I am currently searching for a placement for 2023/2024. 
    </p>
    <p>Web programming has been a passion that I have only discovered very recently but quickly became interested in. I have had an interest in programming for years using languages like Python, however they did not fully appeal to me like front-end web programming languages have. I am always learning something new developing websites which further propels my enjoyment in the process.
    </p>
    <p>My other interests are playing video games, which have been a massive hobby of mine for most of my life. I also go to the gym regularly as I have began focusing on improving my self and my health over the past year by staying active. I also enjoy going out with friends to socialise and having a laugh. Furthermore, I also watch a lot of tech youtubers as I am interested in new technology coming out all of the time and how technology is evolving rapidly.
