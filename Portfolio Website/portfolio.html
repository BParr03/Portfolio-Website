 <p>
    This project was created during my first year of university for my Introduction to Web Programming module final assignment. I was required to create a website that contained an array of information about endangered animals, then create an interactive website through JavaScript that would let the user find out more information about each animals by selecting different options; for example selecting habitat.

<p>
    This project was initially created in my first year of university in my Project 1 module. The website was only created to be used as a template to be screenshotted as part of the group report for what a website of our project would look like. However, in my free time i decided to develop the website into a fully functioning currency converter where you can select any amount and any currency displayed on the website.

<p>
    This project was created in my second year of university for my Web Development module assignment. I was required to create a website that was connected to a database and upload the data that would be submitted from the form displayed on the website and save the information onto the database and then display the details submitted onto a separate page on the website. This website was created using HTML, CSS and mostly PHP. SQL was also used to gather/retrieve information to/from the database.
